## 🗂️ HOW DATA WORKS

**Important**: This version uses **browser local storage**

✅ **Good**:

- Instant and fast
- Free forever
- No database setup

⚠️ **Limitations**:
- Data stays on that person's computer only
- If someone uses the file, their data is separate
- Clearing browser data = losing registrations
- Not shared across devices

**Perfect for**:
